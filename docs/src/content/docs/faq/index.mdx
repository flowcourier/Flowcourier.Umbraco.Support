# FAQ


## Can I use the free license for a commercial project?
Yes, you can use the free license for a commercial project.

When you install the extension without providing a license, it runs in **Free Edition** mode by default. This includes a 30-day data view limit. If you want access to additional features such as filters, you need to upgrade to the **Paid License**. A valid license key will be provided upon purchase.

If you experience issues, please contact us at [support@flowcourier.com](mailto:support@flowcourier.com).

## Can I run the extension in localhost or headless environments?
Yes. The extension works regardless of where Umbraco is runningâ€”whether it's `http://localhost`, `https://staging.mysite.com`, or `https://intranet`.

What matters is the **base URL configured in Google Analytics**, not the Umbraco domain itself. This design supports local development, internal use, staging, test, and headless setups.

For example:
- You have Umbraco running on `http://localhost/`
- Your Google Analytics is tracking `https://www.example.com/`

In this case, your Umbraco home node `http://localhost/` maps to the GA view of `https://www.example.com/`. To view stats for `https://www.example.com/my-page`, simply create a matching Umbraco page at `http://localhost/my-page`.


## Umbraco v14 - v17
We are working on the compatibility to the next major release (LTS) of Umbraco.

## Can I have a feature request?
Yes, you can have a feature request. Please contact us at GitHub [https://github.com/flowcourier/Flowcourier.Umbraco.Support](https://github.com/flowcourier/Flowcourier.Umbraco.Support)

## What happen to Matomo support?
We did not get enough interest to continue developing the Matomo connector. If you are interested in Matomo support, please contact us.


## If after clicking the 'Finish' button you're getting the 'Invalid grant' error message, please check the following:

- Your service account has the correct role ('Editor' or 'Owner');
- You have created the service account under the same Google account you use for Google Analytics;
- The local time is in sync with the server time (maximum admissible difference is 5 minutes).

## Statistics not loading in my Umbraco instance, Google Chrome inspector shows 500 errors on requests.

1. Double check that you have provided complete JSON object to credentials field in Umbraco Settings
2. Test the credentials with an empty Umbraco installation, you can do this easily by running commands:
~~~
dotnet new install Umbraco.Templates::13.*
dotnet new umbraco -n "v13"
cd v13
dotnet add package Clean --version 4.*
dotnet add package Flowcourier.Umbraco.Analytics --version 13.1.0-rc1
dotnet run
~~~
Then add your Google Service Account credentials with configuration in Settings area and check that analytics loads on the home node. If they are not loading, your problem is on Google credentials or Google Analytics configuration. If it loads then the problem might be on some customization in Umbraco. Try following:

1. Check Umbraco logs, just in case there is more detailed error logging related to this issue?
2. Are you using some specific json serializer in the project?
3. Please contact us at GitHub [https://github.com/flowcourier/Flowcourier.Umbraco.Support](https://github.com/flowcourier/Flowcourier.Umbraco.Support)
