title: 4. Extension configuration in Umbraco
description:  Umbraco Configuration guide for the website analytics reporting extension

---

On this last step, we will configure the extension in Umbraco to use the Service Account to access Google Analytics and Search reports and PageSpeed Insights reports.

The Google Analytics by Flowcourier UI is split over three sections within the Umbraco back-office:

* Settings / Flowcourier For managing connections
* Analytics For getting site wide statistics, basically Google Analytics Overview
* Content / Visitors For viewing page specific statistics


## Create data Connection in Umbraco Settings

To create a new connection to Google Analytics, you need to go to the Flowcourier settings in Umbraco back-office as Umbraco Administrator.



In order to access these sections, we will need to ensure our User account has the relevant permissions to do so. If you are logged in as Administrator, you will likely already have access to the Settings and Content sections. If you are not an Administrator however, you will need to assign your user account to the Administrators User Group.

To gain access to the Analytics section however, will require some additional configuration.

## Creating a Analytics User Group
To gain access to the Analytics section, it is advised that you create a new User Group called Analytics, assigning our User account to that User Group and allowing that User Group access to the Analytics section as a whole. By creating a custom User Group in this way it provides an easier method of managing Users who have access to the Analytics section, rather than allowing individual Users access.

To create the Analytics User Group you should follow the instructions on how to create a User Group available on the Umbraco Documentation site, ensuring you select the Analytics section in the Sections list, as well as selecting your User account in the Users list, as per the screenshot below.

## Accessing the Analytics Section
Once created and assigned, you should be able to refresh the back-office and see that we now have access to the new Analytics section.


## Install License

Once you have purchased a license you can install it by dropping the license file directly into your sites umbraco\Licenses folder. Flowcourier will automatically scan this directory for any valid licenses.





## Step 3: Add Service Account User to Umbraco

In this final step, we tell Google Analytics by Flowcourier to use the Service Account to read data from Google Analytics.

### 1:  Go to Google Cloud Console IAM & Admin 
Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=flowcourieranalytics) and in IAM & Admin, open Service Accounts. Then click your Service Account.
